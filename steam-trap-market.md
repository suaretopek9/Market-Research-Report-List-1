<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steam Trap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermodynamic</li><li>Mechanical</li><li>Thermostatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steam traps are devices used in steam systems to remove condensate (liquid) and air from the system without letting steam escape. Thermodynamic steam traps use the dynamic properties of steam to operate, allowing condensate to pass through while blocking steam. Mechanical steam traps rely on float mechanisms to open and close valves, allowing condensate to discharge. Thermostatic steam traps use a bimetallic element that expands and contracts with temperature changes, opening and closing a valve accordingly. Each trap type has distinct advantages and is suited for different applications in various industries.</p></p>
