<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable & Transportable Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The portable and transportable neonatal ventilators market includes two main types: invasive ventilators and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators are used in neonatal intensive care units and provide mechanical support through a breathing tube placed directly into the baby's airway. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver breathing support without the need for intubation, using interfaces like nasal masks or prongs. Both types aim to assist with respiratory functions and are designed for easy transport and convenience in neonatal care settings.</p></p>
