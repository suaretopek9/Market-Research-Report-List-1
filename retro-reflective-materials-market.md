<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retro-Reflective Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microprismatic</li><li>Glass Beads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retro-reflective materials are used to increase visibility and safety in low-light conditions. The market includes two main types: microprismatic and glass beads. Microprismatic materials are made of small, cube-shaped cells that reflect light back to its source. These materials are highly efficient and durable, making them ideal for traffic signs and safety vests. Glass beads are spherical particles that provide a bright reflection when light hits them. They are commonly used in road markings and traffic signs. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing visibility and ensuring safety on the road.</p></p>
