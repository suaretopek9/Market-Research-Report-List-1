<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optically Clear Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Float Glass</li><li>Rolled Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optically clear glass is a type of glass that is exceptionally transparent with minimal distortion, making it ideal for applications requiring high clarity and visibility. There are two main types of optically clear glass in the market: float glass and rolled glass. Float glass is produced by floating molten glass on a bed of molten tin, resulting in a smooth and uniform surface with excellent optical properties. Rolled glass, on the other hand, is manufactured by passing molten glass between two rollers, creating a sheet with a consistent thickness and clarity.</p></p>
