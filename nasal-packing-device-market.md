<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nasal Packing Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bioabsorbable Device</li><li>Biological Nonabsorbent Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nasal packing devices are categorized into two main types: bioabsorbable devices and biological nonabsorbent devices. Bioabsorbable devices are made of materials that dissolve over time within the body, reducing the need for removal after healing. On the other hand, biological nonabsorbent devices are made of materials that are not absorbed by the body and may need to be removed after use. Both types of devices are used for controlling bleeding, supporting healing, and preventing adhesions in the nasal cavity.</p></p>
