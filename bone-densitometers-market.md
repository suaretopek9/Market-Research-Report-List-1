<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Densitometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)</li><li>Ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone densitometers are devices used to measure bone mineral density, important for diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing fracture risk. The market is segmented into two main types - DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and ultrasound. DEXA is considered the gold standard for bone density measurement due to its accuracy and precision. Ultrasound technology offers a portable, cost-effective alternative to DEXA, although it may not be as accurate in certain populations. Both types play a crucial role in managing bone health and preventing fractures.</p></p>
