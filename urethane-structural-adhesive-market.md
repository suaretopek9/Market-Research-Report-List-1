<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urethane Structural Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-component</li><li>Two-component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Urethane structural adhesives are available in two main types: single-component and two-component. Single-component adhesives come ready to use straight from the package, making them convenient for quick applications. On the other hand, two-component adhesives require mixing of two separate components before application, offering better control over working time and curing speed. Both types provide strong bonding capabilities, but the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the project in terms of ease of use, curing time, and bond strength.</p></p>
