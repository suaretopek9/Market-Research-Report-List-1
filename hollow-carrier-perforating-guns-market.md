<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hollow-carrier Perforating Guns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WCP Type</li><li>TCP Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hollow-carrier perforating guns are used for creating holes in oil and gas wells in order to improve production. There are two main types of hollow-carrier perforating guns - WCP (through-tubing conveyed) and TCP (tubing conveyed). WCP guns are conveyed through tubing inside the wellbore, making them suitable for well interventions where the tubing is already installed. TCP guns are conveyed externally on coiled tubing or wireline, making them ideal for new well completions or interventions where the tubing is not yet in place.</p></p>
