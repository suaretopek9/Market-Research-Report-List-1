<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrogalvanizing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cyanide Galvanizing</li><li>Zinc Galvanizing</li><li>Chloride Galvanizing</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrogalvanizing is a process that involves coating metal surfaces with zinc in order to protect them from corrosion. Cyanide Galvanizing is a type of electrogalvanizing that uses a bath containing cyanide salts to deposit a thin layer of zinc onto the metal surface. Zinc Galvanizing, on the other hand, uses a bath without cyanide salts. Chloride Galvanizing is similar to zinc galvanizing, but it uses a chloride-based bath instead. Lastly, "Others" market refers to any other types of electrogalvanizing processes that do not fall under the aforementioned categories.</p></p>
