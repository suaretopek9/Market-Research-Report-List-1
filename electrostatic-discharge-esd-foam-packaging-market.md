<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Foam Packaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal</li><li>Conductive</li><li>Dissipative Polymer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) foam packaging is designed to protect electronic components from damage caused by static electricity. There are three main types of ESD foam packaging: metal, conductive, and dissipative polymer. Metal foam packaging uses metal particles to provide a shield against static electricity. Conductive foam packaging contains conductive materials to safely disperse static charges. Dissipative polymer foam packaging features materials that dissipate static charges gradually to prevent damage to sensitive electronics. Each type offers different levels of protection against ESD.</p></p>
