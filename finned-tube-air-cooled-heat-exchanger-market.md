<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Finned Tube Air Cooled Heat Exchanger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Longitudinal Type</li><li>Transverse Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Finned tube air-cooled heat exchangers are classified into two main types based on the orientation of the fins: longitudinal type and transverse type. In longitudinal type, the fins run parallel to the tubes, allowing for efficient heat transfer along the length of the tubes. In transverse type, the fins are perpendicular to the tubes, promoting heat transfer across the width of the tubes. Both types are commonly used in industrial applications to cool fluids by utilizing ambient air flow over the finned tubes.</p></p>
