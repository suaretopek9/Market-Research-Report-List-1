<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Window Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Coating</li><li>Hydrophobic Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-cleaning window market offers two main types of coatings, hydrophilic and hydrophobic. Hydrophilic coatings attract water molecules, causing them to spread out and form a thin film that washes away dirt and stains when it rains or is sprayed with water. On the other hand, hydrophobic coatings repel water, causing it to form droplets that easily roll off the surface, carrying dirt and debris with them. Both types of coatings help to keep windows clean and maintain visibility.</p></p>
