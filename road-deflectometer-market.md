<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Deflectometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD)</li><li>Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Road deflectometer market refers to the different types of equipment used to measure pavement deflection under a moving wheel load. Two common types are Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) and Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD). FWDs use a heavy weight dropped onto the pavement to measure deflection, while LWDs are portable and use a lighter load. Both types provide valuable data for assessing pavement strength and performance, helping engineers make informed decisions about maintenance and rehabilitation strategies.</p></p>
