<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ag-Lime Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Quicklime</li><li>Slaked Lime</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ag-Lime refers to agricultural lime, which is used to improve soil pH levels in order to enhance crop yields. Quicklime is a fast-acting type of agricultural lime that is produced by heating limestone to high temperatures. Slaked lime, also known as hydrated lime, is a slower-acting form of agricultural lime that is produced by adding water to quicklime. Quicklime is typically used for more urgent soil pH adjustments, while slaked lime is used for longer-term soil improvement. Both types of lime play a crucial role in maintaining healthy soil for agricultural purposes.</p></p>
