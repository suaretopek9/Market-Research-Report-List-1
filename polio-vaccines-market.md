<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polio Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IPV</li><li>OPV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polio vaccines are categorized into two types - IPV and OPV. IPV, or inactivated polio vaccine, is made from killed poliovirus and is given through injection. It provides immunity against all three types of poliovirus and is mainly used in countries that have eliminated polio. OPV, or oral polio vaccine, contains live but weakened poliovirus strains and is administered orally. It provides immunity in the intestines, preventing the spread of the virus to others. OPV is widely used in countries where polio is still present due to its ability to enhance herd immunity.</p></p>
