<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auxins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Auxins</li><li>Synthesis Auxins</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural auxins are plant hormones that occur naturally in plants and regulate various growth processes such as cell elongation and differentiation. They are extracted from plant sources and used in agriculture to promote root development, fruit ripening, and flowering. On the other hand, synthetic auxins are artificially produced in laboratories and have similar effects to natural auxins. They are widely used in agriculture as well, to control plant growth and development, enhance herbicide efficacy, and stimulate root formation in cuttings. Both types of auxins play a crucial role in plant growth and development.</p></p>
