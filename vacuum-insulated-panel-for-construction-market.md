<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Insulated Panel for Construction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fumed Silica</li><li>Glass Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum insulated panels for construction can be divided into two main types based on the materials used in their construction: fumed silica and glass fiber. Fumed silica panels consist of a core material made from a highly porous, low-density silica that is capable of trapping air molecules to provide insulation. On the other hand, glass fiber panels utilize a core material composed of densely compacted glass fibers that are highly efficient in limiting the transfer of heat. Both types of panels are popular choices in the construction industry for their excellent insulating properties.</p></p>
