<p><strong>The Gas Injected Enhanced Oil Recovery Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Onshore</li><li>Offshore</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas Injected Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) is an advanced technique used to extract oil from reservoirs that have already been through primary and secondary recovery methods. Onshore gas injected EOR involves injecting gas (such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen) into oil wells located on land, increasing the pressure and facilitating the oil's flow to the surface. Offshore gas injected EOR, on the other hand, refers to the same process but in oil wells located beneath the seabed. Both onshore and offshore markets for gas injected EOR offer significant potential for increasing oil recovery and maximizing production efficiency.</p></p>
