<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi-Pole Lighting Contactors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanically Held</li><li>Electrically Held</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multi-pole lighting contactors are devices used to control the lighting in commercial and industrial buildings. There are two main types of multi-pole lighting contactors: mechanically held and electrically held. Mechanically held contactors require a physical mechanism to keep the contacts in the closed position, while electrically held contactors use an electrical signal to keep the contacts closed. Both types serve the same purpose of controlling lighting circuits, but their mechanisms for holding the contacts vary.</p></p>
