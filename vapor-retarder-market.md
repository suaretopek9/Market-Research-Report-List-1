<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vapor Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Less than 0.1 Perm</li><li>0.1 Perm-1.0 Perm</li><li>1.0 Perm-10 Perm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vapor retarders are categorized based on their perm rating, which measures the material's ability to resist vapor transmission. Vapor retarders with less than 0.1 perm are considered highly impermeable, providing excellent moisture protection. Those with a perm rating between 0.1-1.0 are moderately permeable, offering balanced vapor control. Vapor retarders with a perm rating between 1.0-10 are considered more permeable, allowing for some vapor transmission while still providing protection against moisture. Each type of vapor retarder serves a specific purpose depending on the level of vapor control needed.</p></p>
